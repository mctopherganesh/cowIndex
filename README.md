# Welcome to CowDex (The name is a work in progress too)

 This is an ongoing project. The objective is to learn about cows
and web development and design. Hopefully I learn about many other
things as well like research, professionally writing and what-have-you.

Until then, I hope to solely get hands-on experience for the entire
web development process.

If you would like to contribute to this project, let me know! At this 
current juncture, I'm not sure how that would go but let's figure it out!
